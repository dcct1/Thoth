 

Programme Brief
The transition teacher Mrs Murphy has asked me to design and build a computer database that will teach children life lessons through music.
The program will ask the parent to create an account and choose a playlist of 10 songs. The songs must all be based on a theme and a have a message about something they have learned in life. This is to inspire young minds and try to teach them life lessons.
Each song must have a
•	Title
•	Message
•	Link to the song
The teacher has asked us to add any functionality we see necessary.

Additional Functions
•	I would like to have a good graphical user interface for the teacher and students to be able to easily access the playlists.
•	A designed Database that a user can be added to and deleted from easily.
•	The ability to list all songs in the database not just by playlist.

Proof of Concept
For the proof of concept I will build a database with 3 tables User, Music and userMusic.
The user table will contain at first 3 users, the music table will contain a list of all the music and which playlist it is part of, the userMusic table will have a playlist ID and user ID.
We will build 3 menu items using java programming that will call from the 3 tables.
This will hopefully demonstrate a Minimum Viable Product to the teacher have all of the functionality required.

MVP Next Phase
For the next phase the Minimum Viable Product we will need will be to get design more functionality of our database and create a graphical interface.
